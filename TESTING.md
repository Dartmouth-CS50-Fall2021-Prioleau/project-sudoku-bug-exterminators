- Unit Test
	- Unit test has been implemented within each module, except sudoku which use the `testing.sh`

- Our testing consists of four parts:
	- Part I: Argument Validation
	- Part II: Testing creator 
	- Part III: Testing solver
	- Part Iv: Testing average time for creating and solving 
	- run: `bash -v testing.sh`

Each part consists of a series of test cases. Please refer to the description of each cases for detailed information.
